ideas - 

* most compact design: when visually limited, don't show both map and story (just one or the other). [fixed position map icon top right]
* When user swipes to sides, should move forwards, backwards through content.  both small and large screens should work this way. 
* Provide on-screen user-friendly error message when we are missing an internet connection
* Provide testing interface that doesn't use internet
* test on IE (especially JS: map, history api; and responsive)
* En/Es switcher
* Photo previews in letter area on page load
* Info icon / hide icon in header
* "click map or start with _Jane_Random's_story_."
